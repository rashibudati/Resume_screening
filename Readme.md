#### This Project takes a resume document and gives the summary and the most relevant position of a candidate.

Since there was no labelled data, I have done a rule based learning to get the candidate information.

You can download the requirements from requirements.txt by running the command

pip install -r requirements.txt

You can unzip the dataset.zip folder to get different set of resume documents to run this rule based system.
You can also get the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/palaksood97/resume-dataset

Use the input_file.py in src folder to give the path of resume document. 
Run python input_file.py
